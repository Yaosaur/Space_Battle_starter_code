        Welcome aboard, Captain. As you know, Earth is getting invaded by a
        swarm of alien ships. Thankfully the aliens are not very smart and will
        only deploy one ship at a time. Press Battle to begin. After each ship
        is destroyed you can choose to retreat or keep going.

        Thank you for saving us, Captain! Would you like to enlist for the next
        mission? Or would you like try our virtual simulator?

          I hope you had some rest, Captain. The aliens are back with bigger,
          stronger ships. Don't worry. We have upgraded your ship's hull. Our
          tech is still in progress, so its a random upgrade... On the bright
          side, after defeating enemy ships, you will be able to salvage their
          parts. These scraps can be used to repair your ship and purchase
          upgrades at the end of the round. Also, we added a special missle on
          your ship! It will do a ton of damage and will never miss...but it can
          only be used once, so do be mindful of that. Good luck out there!
