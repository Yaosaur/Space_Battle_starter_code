# Space Wars

Space Wars is a point and click text based single player game where the main goal is destroy all alien ships invading Earth. The player will serve as the Captain of the humankind's ship and decide each round whether to attack or retreat. The player and alien ship attacks are automatic and the outcome of the battle will be recorded in the battle log. The initial round of the game serves as a tutorial for the player to understand the flow of the game. At the end of the game, the player can decide to redo the tutorial or to move on to the real game. The real game will restart the game with additional features. If at any point the player ship's hull (health) hits 0, the game is over.
